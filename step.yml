  Danger runs during your CI process, and gives teams the chance to automate common code review chores. This provides another logical step in your build, through this Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review. You can use Danger to codify your teams norms. Leaving humans to think about harder problems. She does this by leaving messages inside your PRs based on rules that you create with the Ruby scripting language. Over time, as rules are adhered to, the message is amended to reflect the current state of the code review.

          **SETTING UP AN ACCESS TOKEN**

          [Here’s the link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), you should open this in the private session where you just created the new GitHub account. Again, the rights that you give to the token depend on the openness of your projects. You’ll want to save for later, when you add a `github_api_token` to the step.
          
          **TOKENS FOR OSS PROJECTS**

          We recommend giving the token the smallest scope possible. This means just public\_repo, this scopes limits Danger’s abilities to just writing comments on OSS projects. Because the token can be quite easily be extracted from the CI environment, this minimizes the chance for bad actors to cause chaos with it.
          
          **TOKENS FOR CLOSED SOURCE PROJECTS**

          We recommend giving access to the whole repo scope, and its children.

          You can work with GitHub Enterprise by setting the `github_host` and the `github_api_base_url` inputs.

          **For example:** `git.corp.evilcorp.com`

          If you are self hosting GitLab, you’ll need to generate an access token for the bot user. You can find the section under “Access Tokens” in the bot user’s profile.
